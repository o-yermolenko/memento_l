## The Problem (Raw Version)

The user isn't **just stressed or anxious**. They're **emotionally untethered** — reacting before they can think, carrying feelings they can't name, and wondering why they can't just "handle life" like everyone else seems to.

Somewhere along the way, their emotional responses got wired for survival, not thriving. Now every minor frustration feels major. Every criticism lands too deep. Every quiet moment fills with unease.

Now they're here. Functional enough on the outside. Overwhelmed on the inside. They've tried breathing exercises, mindfulness apps, positive affirmations. None of it stuck because **none of it addressed the root: their emotional operating system is running outdated code**.

They've tried willpower. They've tried "just letting it go." They've tried ignoring it until it explodes.

**They're not weak. They're running on emotional patterns that were never designed for the life they're living now.**

---

## The 2AM Voice

> "Why do I react so intensely to things that shouldn't bother me?"

> "I feel exhausted from feeling everything so much."

> "Everyone else handles stress normally. What's wrong with me?"

> "I know I'm being irrational, but I can't stop the spiral."

> "I carry this heaviness everywhere and I don't even know what it is."

> "Sometimes I don't even know what I'm feeling — just that it's too much."

---

## The Secret Belief They Won't Admit

> "I'm fundamentally too emotional, and I'll never feel stable or in control of myself."

---

## The Reframe

| Old Story | New Story |
|-----------|-----------|
| "I'm too sensitive. I'm broken. I've always been emotional and I can't control it. Something is fundamentally wrong with me." | "Your emotional responses were shaped by experiences that required survival mode. That sensitivity isn't weakness — it's a system calibrated for threats that no longer exist. With the right tools, you can recalibrate how you respond and finally feel steady from the inside out." |

---

## Proprietary Language

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Emotional Blueprint** | Your unique pattern of emotional responses shaped by past experiences |
| **Inner Calibration** | The process of resetting your emotional responses to match your current life |

---

## Core Hooks

| "Your emotions don't come with instructions" | Universal truth — immediate agreement, matches Liven's "Life comes without a manual" |
| "Finally understand why you feel the way you feel" | Curiosity gap + promise of self-knowledge |
| "Train your emotional responses, not just your thoughts" | Differentiation from CBT-only approaches |

## Emotional Funnel

### Level 1: Pain (Meet Them in the Overwhelm)

You've tried to hold it together. Most of the time, you manage. But underneath? There's this constant hum of... too much. Too reactive. Too sensitive. Too exhausted from feeling everything so deeply. You don't know why your emotional volume is stuck on high when everyone else seems to navigate life on a reasonable setting.

### Level 2: Recognition (Name What They've Never Articulated)

It's not that you're "too emotional." It's that your Emotional Blueprint — the pattern of responses you've carried since childhood — was designed for survival, not for the life you're living now. Your system learned to react fast and feel deeply. That was adaptive once. Now it's exhausting.

### Level 3: Reframe (Shift Blame, Open the Door)

Here's what no one told you: your emotional responses aren't character flaws. They're learned patterns. And anything learned can be re-learned. The goal isn't to feel less — it's to respond differently. To catch the wave before it crashes. To finally feel steady, not numb.

### Level 4: Validation (Permission to Believe Change is Possible)

Over 2,500,000 people have already started this journey. They weren't special or uniquely capable. They just found the right approach — one that works with their emotional system instead of against it. The fact that you feel things deeply? That's not the bug. That's the feature you're about to learn to use.

### Level 5: Solution (Now Memento Makes Sense)

Memento is your personalized path to emotional stability. A program built around your specific patterns. Daily practices that actually stick. An AI companion for the moments between — when you need support but not a full therapy session. It's not about becoming someone different. It's about finally understanding who you are and working with it.

---

## Core Messaging

**Headline:**
> "Your emotions don't come with instructions"

**Sub-headline:**
> "Memento helps you understand your patterns, rewire your responses, and build lasting inner stability — with AI support whenever you need it."

**Value Proposition:**
Memento helps you understand why you feel the way you feel and gives you practical tools to respond differently — so you can finally feel steady from the inside out.

**Description:**
Most emotional wellness apps ask you to meditate your problems away. Memento goes deeper. With a personalized program built around your unique Emotional Blueprint, daily micro-practices, reflective journaling, and an AI companion available 24/7, you'll learn to work with your emotional system — not against it. Backed by behavioral science. Built for real life.

---

## Positioning

| What It's NOT | What It IS |
|---------------|------------|
| Generic meditation app | Personalized emotional training |
| "Just breathe" advice | Pattern recognition + response rewiring |
| One-size-fits-all content | Program built around YOUR blueprint |
| Cold wellness technology | Your Inner Ally — warm, supportive AI |
| Surface-level mood tracking | Deep insight into why you feel this way |
| Scheduled-only support | 24/7 AI companion for real moments |
| Suppressing emotions | Understanding and working with them |

---

## Emotional Triggers Map

| Trigger | Intensity | Copy Approach |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| Emotional overwhelm | Highest | Lead with validation: "Exhausted from feeling everything so deeply?" |
| Reactivity/overreaction | High | Reframe: "Your reactions aren't flaws — they're patterns that can change" |
| Not understanding own feelings | High | Promise: "Finally understand why you feel this way" |
| Comparison to "normal" people | Medium-High | Normalize: "Over 2.5M people feel exactly like you do" |
| Self-criticism | High | Disarm: "Your Inner Ally won't judge — it'll help" |
| Feeling alone/unsupported | Medium-High | Solve: "Support when you need it, not just when you schedule it" |
| Past failed attempts | Medium | Differentiate: "This isn't another meditation app" |

---

## Toxic Hooks (Confrontational — Use in Retargeting/Testing)

- "You've tried to meditate your way out of this. It didn't work."
- "Your emotional responses were set in childhood. You're still running that code."
- "Everyone tells you to 'just breathe.' Has it ever actually worked?"
- "That 'too sensitive' label you've carried? It's a feature, not a bug. Time to learn how to use it."
- "You know something's off. You've known for years. The question is: what are you going to do about it?"
- "Therapy once a week. Emotions 24/7. The math doesn't work."

---

## The Enemy

**Primary:** Outdated Emotional Programming

> Your emotional responses were calibrated by experiences you didn't choose — childhood dynamics, past relationships, accumulated stress. That programming made sense then. It's sabotaging you now. The enemy isn't your emotions. It's the outdated system running them.

**Secondary:**
- **Generic wellness industry** — "Just meditate" advice that ignores real patterns
- **The stigma of "too emotional"** — labels that shame instead of explain
- **The inner critic** — the voice that says you're broken instead of learnable
- **Isolation** — struggling alone when support should be available

### Visual Style Guidelines

1. **Photography:** Use warm, natural photography of diverse, real people (not stock-looking). Prefer professional, aspirational imagery like Liven.

2. **Illustrations:** Minimal use. When needed, simple line illustrations in orange or muted tones.

3. **Icons:** Custom icon set with orange accent color for selected/active states.

4. **Spacing:** Generous whitespace. Use 8px grid system.

5. **Animations:** Subtle, purposeful. Fade-in on scroll, smooth transitions (200-300ms). Rive animations for key moments.

6. **Light Theme:** Warm cream background (#F6F4F0) creates calm, trustworthy, approachable mood.

7. **Orange Usage:** Primary CTAs, highlights, progress indicators, selected states. Key brand differentiator from Liven's green.
