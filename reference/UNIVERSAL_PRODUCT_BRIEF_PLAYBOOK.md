# Universal Product Brief Playbook

A framework for decomposing any product to its emotional core — the deep human truth it serves, the pain it addresses, and the transformation it promises.

---

## Why This Exists

Most product documentation describes **what** a product does. This playbook helps you uncover **why it matters** — at the level where humans actually make decisions: emotion, identity, and unspoken pain.

Use this to:
- Deeply understand competitors
- Reverse-engineer successful products
- Create emotionally resonant positioning for your own products
- Find the "soul" of any product

---

## The Framework

### 1. Surface Layer: What It Is

Start with the basics. One paragraph max.

```
[Product Name] is a [category] for [target user] that [primary function].
Format: [delivery method]. [Key differentiator].
```

**Example:**
> Memento is a structured self-reconnection program for people who've lost themselves while building a life they thought they wanted. Format: 8 chapters with daily rituals. Built on schema therapy principles.

**Questions to answer:**
- What category does it belong to?
- Who is it for (surface level)?
- What does it do (functional description)?
- How is it delivered?

---

### 2. The Problem (Raw Version)

Go beyond the obvious problem. Find the **real** pain — the one users feel but can't articulate.

**Template:**

```markdown
## The Problem (Raw Version)

The user isn't [surface symptom]. They're [deeper truth].

[Origin story of the pain — when/how it started]

Now they're here. [Current state description]. And [the real feeling].

They've tried [common solutions]. None of it worked because [why those solutions miss the point]:

**They're not [surface problem]. They're [real problem].**
```

**Key questions:**
- What's the surface-level problem they'd Google?
- What's the deeper problem they can't name?
- When did this problem actually start?
- What have they tried that failed? Why did it fail?
- What's the one-sentence reframe of their real problem?

---

### 3. The 2AM Voice

These are the thoughts that haunt your user at 2AM when they can't sleep. The things they'd never say out loud. The internal monologue of someone in pain.

**Template:**

```markdown
## The 2AM Voice

> "[Doubt about self/identity]"

> "[Comparison to others]"

> "[Question about effort vs. results]"

> "[Feeling of alienation]"

> "[The void/what's missing]"
```

**How to find these:**
- Reddit posts in relevant subreddits (sort by "top")
- Amazon reviews of competitor products (especially 2-3 star reviews)
- Therapy forums / mental health communities
- YouTube comment sections on related topics
- Direct user interviews ("What keeps you up at night about this?")

**Characteristics of good 2AM voice quotes:**
- First person ("I...")
- Present tense or present perfect ("I don't..." / "I've been...")
- Contain self-doubt or confusion
- Often end with questions or ellipses
- Sound like thoughts, not statements

---

### 4. The Secret Belief

The one thing they believe about themselves that they'd never admit — the core shame or fear driving the behavior.

**Template:**

```markdown
## The Secret Belief They Won't Admit

> "[Core belief about self — usually involves shame, inadequacy, or fear]"
```

**Examples by category:**

| Category | Secret Belief |
|----------|---------------|
| Productivity | "I'm fundamentally lazy and broken" |
| Dating | "I'm unlovable as I actually am" |
| Fitness | "I don't have what it takes" |
| Career | "I'm a fraud and everyone will find out" |
| Self-help | "I abandoned myself and don't know how to come back" |
| Finance | "I'm bad with money and always will be" |

**How to identify:**
- What would they be mortified if others knew?
- What belief, if true, would explain all their struggles?
- What are they trying to disprove by buying solutions?

---

### 5. The Reframe

The narrative shift that makes the product make sense. Takes the old story (self-blame, shame) and creates a new story (externalized cause, hope).

**Template:**

```markdown
## The Reframe

| Old Story | New Story |
|-----------|-----------|
| "[Self-blaming narrative]" | "[Externalized cause + path forward]" |
```

**Structure of a powerful reframe:**

**Old Story elements:**
- Self-blame ("I'm...")
- Permanence ("always," "fundamentally")
- Character flaw framing

**New Story elements:**
- External cause (conditioning, system, circumstance)
- Learned behavior (can be unlearned)
- Signal, not flaw ("The [symptom] isn't a bug — it's proof that...")
- Agency restored ("And I can...")

**Examples:**

| Old Story | New Story |
|-----------|-----------|
| "I'm lazy" | "I was trained to follow a system that drains me. My exhaustion is rational." |
| "I'm bad at relationships" | "I learned attachment patterns that served survival, not connection. I can learn new ones." |
| "I have no willpower" | "Willpower isn't the problem. The system was designed to deplete it." |

---

### 6. Proprietary Language

Coined terms that name experiences users have but couldn't articulate. These create "aha" moments and make the product feel like it *understands*.

**Template:**

```markdown
## Proprietary Language

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **[Coined Term]** | [Clear definition of the experience/pattern/state] |
| **[Coined Term]** | [Clear definition] |
```

**Types of proprietary terms:**

1. **Conditions/States** — Names for how they feel
   - Example: "Self-Exile" — being gone from your own life while still present

2. **Patterns** — Names for recurring behaviors
   - Example: "Self-Abandonment Pattern" — leaving yourself to meet others' expectations

3. **Enemies** — Names for external forces
   - Example: "The Script" — the external template you were given to follow

4. **Processes** — Names for transformation
   - Example: "The Return" — the process of coming back to yourself

5. **Pseudo-diagnostics** — Clinical-sounding terms that validate
   - Example: "Identity Disconnection" — sounds medical, creates legitimacy

**Rules for good proprietary language:**
- 2-3 words max
- Capitalised (signals importance)
- Immediately understandable
- Creates "that's exactly what I have" feeling
- Can be used in sentences naturally

---

### 7. Core Hooks

The one-liner statements that stop people mid-scroll. Each hook has a psychological mechanism.

**Template:**

```markdown
## Core Hooks

| Hook | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|
| "[Hook statement]" | [Why it works psychologically] |
```

**Hook mechanisms to use:**

| Mechanism | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Blame shift | Moves fault from user to external | "You were trained to abandon yourself" |
| Pseudo-diagnostic | Names their condition | "You have a Self-Abandonment Pattern" |
| Void naming | Articulates the unnamed feeling | "The emptiness isn't depression. It's Identity Disconnection." |
| Script externalization | Blames "the system" | "You followed the script. The script was wrong." |
| Childhood origin | Removes blame via early cause | "It started before you had a choice" |
| Hidden truth | Reveals what they suspected | "You're not lost. You left." |
| Permission giving | Allows forbidden feeling | "You're allowed to want more" |

---

### 8. Emotional Funnel

The journey from pain to purchase. Each level deepens engagement.

**Template:**

```markdown
## Emotional Funnel

### Level 1: Pain (Meet Them in the Void)
[Describe their current state. Use "you." Validate the feeling without solving it yet.]

### Level 2: Recognition (Name What They've Never Articulated)
[Put words to the unnamed. Use proprietary language. Create "how do they know?" moment.]

### Level 3: Reframe (Shift Blame, Open the Door)
[Externalize the cause. It's not a flaw — it's a pattern. Origin story.]

### Level 4: Validation (Permission to Believe the Better Story)
[You're not broken. The feeling is proof of something good. Ready signal.]

### Level 5: Solution (Now the Product Makes Sense)
[Introduce product as the logical next step. Not a fix — a path. Structure gives hope.]
```

**Level characteristics:**

| Level | Emotional State | Goal | Tone |
|-------|-----------------|------|------|
| 1. Pain | Alone, stuck | "They see me" | Dark, validating |
| 2. Recognition | Surprised, seen | "They get it" | Precise, naming |
| 3. Reframe | Relieved, curious | "It's not my fault" | Explanatory, freeing |
| 4. Validation | Hopeful, permitted | "I'm not broken" | Warm, affirming |
| 5. Solution | Ready, willing | "This could work" | Clear, structured |

---

### 9. Core Messaging

The essential copy elements.

**Template:**

```markdown
## Core Messaging

**Headline:**
> "[5-7 words. Punchy. Contains the core reframe.]"

**Sub-headline:**
> "[Expands on headline. Introduces proprietary term. Hints at transformation.]"

**Value Proposition:**
[One sentence: What it helps you understand + what it gives you. Not features — outcomes.]

**Description:**
[One paragraph: The contrast (what others assume vs. reality), the diagnosis (proprietary term), the promise (what you'll learn/gain), the format (structure gives credibility).]
```

**Headline formulas:**
- "[Reframe in 5 words]" — "You're not lost. You left."
- "[Counter-intuitive truth]" — "Stop trying to be productive"
- "[Hidden diagnosis]" — "It's not burnout. It's betrayal."
- "[Permission statement]" — "You're allowed to want more"

---

### 10. Positioning Matrix

Define what the product is by defining what it's NOT.

**Template:**

```markdown
## Positioning

| What It's NOT | What It IS |
|---------------|------------|
| [Competitor category] | [Your category] |
| [Common approach] | [Your approach] |
| [Surface solution] | [Deep solution] |
| [Shame-based frame] | [Permission-based frame] |
| [Quick fix] | [Real transformation] |
```

**Common contrasts:**
- Productivity → Presence
- Optimization → Reconnection
- Discipline → Permission
- Habits → Identity
- Quick fix → Structured path
- "Try harder" → "Understand why"
- Self-improvement → Self-reunion

---

### 11. Emotional Triggers Map

Catalog the specific triggers and how to address them.

**Template:**

```markdown
## Emotional Triggers Map

| Trigger | Intensity | Copy Approach |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| [Emotion/state] | [Highest/High/Medium-High/Medium] | [How to address in copy] |
```

**How to rate intensity:**
- **Highest:** Daily pain, identity-level, keeps them up at night
- **High:** Frequent pain, affects self-perception
- **Medium-High:** Regular pain, affects behavior
- **Medium:** Occasional pain, situational

**Copy approach patterns:**
- Highest intensity → Name it first, validate immediately
- High intensity → Reframe as symptom, not flaw
- Medium-High → Connect to deeper cause
- Medium → Offer hope, future-focus

---

### 12. Toxic Hooks (Confrontational)

Aggressive hooks for retargeting or testing. Use carefully.

**Template:**

```markdown
## Toxic Hooks (Confrontational — Use in Retargeting / Testing)

- "[Uncomfortable truth they've been avoiding]"
- "[Calls out their performance/mask]"
- "[Names the void directly]"
- "[Implies they know but won't act]"
```

**Characteristics:**
- Confrontational but not cruel
- Names avoidance behavior
- Implies they already know the truth
- Creates discomfort that demands resolution

**When to use:**
- Retargeting (they've seen gentler messaging)
- A/B testing against softer hooks
- Audiences that respond to challenge
- Cold audiences who need pattern interrupt

---

### 13. The Enemy

Every transformation narrative needs an antagonist.

**Template:**

```markdown
## The Enemy

**Primary:** [Main external force to blame]
[2-3 sentences explaining why this enemy is responsible]

**Secondary:**
- [Supporting enemy 1]
- [Supporting enemy 2]
- [Supporting enemy 3 — often internal voice]
```

**Common enemy types:**

| Enemy Type | Example | Best For |
|------------|---------|----------|
| The System | "The education system" | Career, productivity |
| The Script | "Society's template" | Life purpose, identity |
| The Industry | "Diet culture" | Health, fitness |
| The Conditioning | "How you were raised" | Psychology, relationships |
| The Algorithm | "Social media" | Attention, creativity |
| The Voice | "The inner critic" | Self-worth |

**Rules:**
- Enemy should be external (removes self-blame)
- Enemy should be recognizable (user nods along)
- Enemy should be powerful but defeatable
- Product is the weapon against the enemy
