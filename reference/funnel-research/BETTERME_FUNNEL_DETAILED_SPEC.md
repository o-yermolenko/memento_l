3. **Personalization Promise**: "Personalized" in headline creates expectation of custom results
4. **Immediate Segmentation**: Age data enables targeted content throughout funnel

### Phase 2: Profile Quiz Section ("About Me")

#### Step 2: Gender Selection
**Section Header**: "About me"

**Question**: "What's your gender?"

**Options** (Single-select radio):
- Male
- Female  
- Prefer not to say

**Design**:

---

#### Step 3: Consent/Data Justification Interstitial
**Type**: Persuasive interstitial before deep profiling

**Headline**: "We're happy you're joining us!"

**Body Copy**:
- "To create your daily routine plan, we need to ask a few questions about your mental wellness."
- "Without your consent, we can't offer the customized experience crucial to your journey."

**Visual**: Matching illustration (male/female based on selection)

**CTA**: "I CONSENT" (blue button)

**Psychology Techniques**:
1. **Welcome/Belonging**: "happy you're joining us" creates community feel
2. **Reciprocity Setup**: "we need to ask" implies exchange relationship
3. **FOMO**: "can't offer customized experience" if they don't consent
4. **Commitment**: Clicking "I CONSENT" is a micro-commitment
5. **Trust Building**: Explaining why data is needed before asking

---

#### Step 4: Goals Selection (Multi-Select)
**Question**: "What are your main goals?"
**Instruction**: "Choose all that apply"

**Options**:
- Organize my day better
- Reduce stress & worry
- Improve productivity
- Regain energy and motivation

- Builds psychological investment through selection

---

- Not much, I struggle with it
- Not at all, it's really challenging

**Psychology**:
- Positions organization as a spectrum
- Most users select middle options (admission of need)
- Self-labeling creates commitment to improvement

---

#### Step 6: Energy Level Assessment
**Question**: [About energy levels throughout the day]

**Options**:
- Yes, I'm full of energy throughout the day
- Not exactly, energy declines as the day goes on
- No, I need to boost my energy

**Psychology**:
- Identifies pain point intensity
- "Declines as day goes on" is relatable for most
- Creates problem awareness

---

#### Step 7: Lifestyle Satisfaction
**Question**: [About current lifestyle satisfaction]

**Options**:
- Very satisfied: I'm active and get a lot done
- Somewhat content: I hope to improve it
- Not satisfied: I need a big change

**Psychology**:
- "Big change" language primes for significant solution
- Creates gap between current and desired state
- Justifies need for comprehensive program

---

#### Step 8: Motivational Interstitial

**Headline**: "Let us help you achieve your goals!"

**CTA**: "CONTINUE"
